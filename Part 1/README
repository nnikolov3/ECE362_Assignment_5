 Create a program that creates 4 threads where each thread prints out its thread id.
 The POSIX thread libraries are a standards based thread API for C/C++.
 It allows one to spawn a new concurrent process flow.
 It is most effective on multi-processor or multi-core systems where the process
 flow can be scheduled to run on another processor thus gaining speed through parallel
 or distributed processing. Threads require less overhead than "forking" or spawning
 a new process because the system does not initialize a new system virtual memory space 
 and environment for the process. While most effective on a multiprocessor system, gains 
 are also found on uniprocessor systems which exploit latency in I/O and other system 
 functions which may halt process execution. (One thread may execute while another is 
 waiting for I/O or some other system latency.) Parallel programming technologies 
 such as MPI and PVM are used in a distributed computing environment while threads 
 are limited to a single computer system. All threads within a process share the same address space.
 A thread is spawned by defining a function and it's arguments which will be processed in the thread.
 The purpose of using the POSIX thread library in your software is to execute software faster.
